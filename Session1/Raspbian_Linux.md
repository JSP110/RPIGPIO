# Operating System Raspbian (Linux)

## <a name="rasp1"></a> Introduction to Raspbian

Raspberry Pi has an operating system called Raspbian, which is the official supported Operating System. Download it [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/), or use NOOBS, an easy installer for Raspbian and more. Then you have to copy the image to your SD card.

The advantage of having an operating is getting a user interface. It gives easy access to a regular user for giving commands to the computer and do basic things, without writing any code. The user can just sit there and do things with a computer and get results or do something interesting. In general, for any Linux base operative system, you have two different interfaces: **Graphic interface** and **Text-based interface (terminal or console)**.

* In the  Text-based interface, there are no pull-down menus—you will note a pull-down menu on the top, but it is only accessible when you open the terminal from the Graphic interface, so ignore it for the moment. In the  Text-based interface or terminal,  you just type commands and it prints out the results.
* By now, you might ask *why not always use the graphic interface?* People are very used to the graphic interfaces nowadays, but before it was possible to have one, the Unix system from which Linux originated was only accessible from a terminal and using command lines. The bright side of having a Text-based interface is that give you more control and accessibility to your operative system. The only thing you have to do is to **memorise some commands or look up for them**. It gives you the possibility to control it, programming it remotely without the usage of many resources—the Graphic interface uses a lot of the RAM memory.
* The Graphic user interfaces even though it is easier to use, it ** does not give you access to all the possibilities and capabilities of the operative system**.

In our class, we will stick more with the Graphic interface (it is easier for beginners). However, some tasks are easier to do with the Text-based interface so that we will access the Text-based interface from the Graphic interface to get familiar with the command lines. If you love programming and making prototypes, you will be mostly using the Text-based interface; you will love it!
