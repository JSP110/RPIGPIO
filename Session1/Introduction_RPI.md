## <a name="rpi1"></a> What is a Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi is a small computer of the size of a credit card that you can plug in a TV/monitor, keyboard and mouse. You can use it in the same way as you desktop PC or laptop does, like generating spreadsheets, word processing, browsing the internet, and playing games. It also plays high-definition video. However, what does more interesting Raspberry Pi (RPi), is the capability to make electronics projects with it! The main aim of RPI's design is to teach young people to program and to create new ideas. It has a free licence Linux operative system hold in an SD card and powered by a USB phone charger.

The RPi board shown in the figure, at the right-hand side, you have the **USB ports** and blow that on the right is the port for **Ethernet**. Behind the USB ports,  there is an **interface IC chip** or controller of the USBs and Ethernet. At the top,  you can find the general purpose **I/O GPIO pins** (40 pins). Down the bottom middle is the **CSI (Camera Serial Interface) camera** connector. You can get a camera for Raspberry PI and plug it in. Also, you have the option to connect a webcam to a USB. At the right-hand side, you can find a **DSI (Display Serial Interface) connector** which you can use to connect an LCD screen. At the bottom, you can find the **HDMI port**. HDMI to plug it straight into a monitor. At the bottom, you can find the HDMI port. HDMI to plug it straight into a monitor. Next to the HDMI you can see the** USB power connector** and also an **audio port**.
