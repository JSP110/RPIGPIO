## <a name="rpi1"></a> What is a Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi is a small computer of the size of a credit card that you can plug in a TV/monitor, keyboard and mouse. You can use it in the same way as you desktop PC or laptop does, like generating spreadsheets, word processing, browsing the internet, and playing games. It also plays high-definition video.
